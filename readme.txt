Make your YouTube videos responsive with this easy to use shortcode.

== Description ==

It's never been easier to embed YouTube videos on a WordPress site. Just copy a YouTube video URL and paste between the [youtube] tags on any page of your site and the plugin takes care of the rest.

= Usage =

Includes two shortcodes to make life easier:

*   [youtube]
*   [yt]

Includes basic attributes to make life easier:

*	_url_ attribute can be used in place of pasting the URL between start and end tags.
*	_rel_ can be used to hide the related videos when playback ends.
*	_aspectratio_ can be used to change the proportions of the player. It defaults to 'widescreen' (16:9), so you can change it to 'fullscreen' (4:3) if needed.

= Director's Cut =

The advanced version is coming soon. Get all the features of the basic version plus many more, all in an easy to use shortcode.

== Installation ==

Really easy installation...

1. Upload the `responsive-youtube-videos` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

Now use the shortcode [youtube] or [yt] along with a video URL on any page that you want to display a responsive YouTube video.

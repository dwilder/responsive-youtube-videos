Responsive YouTube Videos
==============================

This is a WordPress plugin uses the shortcode [youtube] to embed a YouTube video on a page using the videos YouTube URL. It's pretty much copy and paste.

It includes a few useful attributes, like:
1. _url_ if you'd rather not use start and end tags.
1. _rel_ if you want to show related posts at the end of playback (yes or no).
1. _aspectratio_ to choose the videos proportions (fullscreen or widescreen).
